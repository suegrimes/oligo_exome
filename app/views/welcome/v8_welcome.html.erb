<h1>Stanford Human OligoExome - Selective Circularization</h1>
<p>Selective Circularization is a scalable oligonucleotide management system for genomic analysis and high-throughput resequencing. This set of capture oligonucleotides will cover the CCDS exon space and a high proportion of related regulatory regions from the human genome. </p>
<p> These capture oligonucleotides utilize a highly multiplexed approach for selectively circularizing and capturing multiple genomic regions using an in-solution method.
  Combined pools of capture oligonucleotides selectively circularize the
  genomic DNA target, followed by specific PCR amplification of regions of interest using a universal primer pair common to all of the
  capture oligonucleotides.  Unlike multiplexed PCR methods, selective genomic circularization is capable of efficiently amplifying
  hundreds of genomic regions simultaneously in multiplex without requiring extensive PCR optimization or producing unwanted side reaction 
  products.  Benefits of the selective genomic circularization method are the relative robustness of the technique and low costs of synthesizing
  standard capture oligonucleotide for selecting genomic targets.</p>
